<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Search For YouTube Videos Based On Input</li>
  <li>Watch YouTube Videos Via Webkit</li>
</ul>

<h3>YouTube Data API:</h3>
<p>Before Using You Need To Obtain An API KEY From Google & Paste It Into The API_KEY Variable in Constants.swift</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs" target="_blank">Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Making This App Gave Me An Oppurtunity To Learn How To Navigate Through Developers Documentation For API's. In My Opinion, This Was My Biggest Takeaway From This Project. In Most Cases, API Developers Layout Exactly How To Use The API & How It Might Respond. The Biggest Challenge In Making This App Was Decoding & Storing The Relevant Info In A Usable Way. Overall, This App Was A Great Learning Oppurtunity For Working With JSON.</p>

<h3>What Was Needed From YouTube</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Video ID</li>
  <li>Video Title</li>
  <li>Channel Title</li>
  <li>HD Thumbnail URL</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample API Response:</h3>

<h3>Improvments Needed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Webkit Wasn't My First Choice As A Video Player However It Is The Most Versatile</li>
  <li>Featured Page Could Be Set To Display Contents Of Popular Playlists</li> 
  <li>Playlists Aren't Available To Be Searched Or Made (Would Need To Add YouTube Sign In)</li>
  <li>Not All Cases Are Covered By The String Formatter (EX: Special Characters In TextField Cause Errors)</li>
</ul>
